# hand2emoji
This project is a computer vision application designed to recognize hand gestures in real-time and map them to their corresponding emojis. Leveraging [OpenCV / MediaPipe / TensorFlow], the system detects hand landmarks from a webcam feed, classifies the gesture, and overlays the matching emoji on the screen.
